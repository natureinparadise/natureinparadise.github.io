      <title>Launching Campaign to Support Madagascar Climate Research</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that we are launching a crowdfunding campaign &amp;lt;/font to support our field research in Madagascar! Our work involves monitoring the microclimate of forested systems, in order to better understand what forest climate is relative to open-air temperatures (which is what weather towers measure), and how much forest climate will change into the future.
We&amp;rsquo;ve made great progress on the campaign so far, raising $3,570 so far in less than a week.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the hard work of the Coastal Carbon Network and collaborators, a bill has been introduced in the US House of Representatives that would fund further efforts to advance blue carbon science (like the Coastal Carbon Network). Exciting to see where this goes!
The bill was introduced by Representative Bonamici of Oregon.
Check out the bill here.</description>

      <title>8 Tips for your GRFP doctors DON&#39;T want you to know</title>
      <link>https://natureinparadise.github.io/blog/grfp-advice/</link>

      <description>These views, although informed by reading lots of other applications and conversations with other researchers, are my own. And it cannot be overstated that applying for the GRF is playing crapshoot: there is no sure way of winning, and the gamble is mostly luck. I felt motivated to write on this topic not because I consider myself an expert of this proposal, but in hopes that perhaps something that I learned through this process can pay off for someone else.</description>

      <description>When you think about conservation, what do you picture? Scientists collecting data in the mud or among the trees? Working with local landowners? Rearing the young of endangered species? While fieldwork is certainly critical, a surprising amount of science is conducted away from the field. The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) GIS lab is heavily involved in remote sensing – that is, collecting data without direct observation. One current project records changes in forest cover in Myanmar (formerly Burma).</description>

      <title>Reaching out: the importance of Outreach</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute!  That&amp;rsquo;s in part because I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty preoccupied with applying for grad school, but also because I&amp;rsquo;ve taken my writing over toMongabay,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;site&amp;nbsp;dedicated&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;environmental&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;conservation&amp;nbsp;news. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my stories ; I especially enjoyed writing the piece on 3D printing reefs, which involved some fascinating conversations with a few individuals at the cutting edge of novel conservation work. Check them out!
Past that, this will be a quick post to share some thoughts on making an impact through your science.</description>

      <title>The Contemporary Science Journalist</title>
      <link>https://natureinparadise.github.io/blog/contemporary-journalist/</link>

      <description>I like writing. This is an adapted version of an essay I wrote for my application to the Medill School of Journalism. Some nebulus, rambling thoughts on the state of journalism. Tossed some buzz words in there to touch all the necessary bases, so have some patience with that. Thanks, enjoy.
The journalist’s toolset has changed. 
It was once a simple kit: a microphone to thrust at politicians or athletes, a notepad to jot down frantic scribbles, a typewriter to weave quotes and notes together.</description>
