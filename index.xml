      <title>8 Tips for your GRFP doctors DON&#39;T want you to know</title>
      <link>https://natureinparadise.github.io/blog/grfp-advice/</link>

      <description>These views, although informed by reading lots of other applications and conversations with other researchers, are my own. And it cannot be overstated that applying for the GRF is playing crapshoot: there is no sure way of winning, and the gamble is mostly luck. I felt motivated to write on this topic not because I consider myself an expert of this proposal, but in hopes that perhaps something that I learned through this process can pay off for someone else.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute!  That&amp;rsquo;s in part because I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty preoccupied with applying for grad school, but also because I&amp;rsquo;ve taken my writing over toMongabay,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;site&amp;nbsp;dedicated&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;environmental&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;conservation&amp;nbsp;news. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my stories ; I especially enjoyed writing the piece on 3D printing reefs, which involved some fascinating conversations with a few individuals at the cutting edge of novel conservation work. Check them out!
Past that, this will be a quick post to share some thoughts on making an impact through your science.</description>

      <description>When you think about conservation, what do you picture? Scientists collecting data in the mud or among the trees? Working with local landowners? Rearing the young of endangered species? While fieldwork is certainly critical, a surprising amount of science is conducted away from the field. The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) GIS lab is heavily involved in remote sensing â€“ that is, collecting data without direct observation. One current project records changes in forest cover in Myanmar (formerly Burma).</description>
