  description: "A record of the meditations, murmurs, and misadventures of Nature Dave in his pursuit of ecological knowledge."
  content: "Despite hundreds of years of observational, experimental, and simulative work, we still have much to learn about our environment. To uncover and disseminate this endless knowledge is critical given the state of anthropogenic global change, as the immense biodiversity and undomesticated landscapes that are the source of natural beauty are imperiled. This website serves to record the endeavors of Dave Klinges on fulfilling these missions."

    One form of conveying the importance of conservation work is through film and photo. See the gallery for some of Nature Dave's work developing multimedia products to share some of the amazing wildlife and scenes he's experienced."
