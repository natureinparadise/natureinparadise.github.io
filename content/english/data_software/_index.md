We designed an R package to download and process ERA5 gridded climate timeseries data, to be ready for use in microclimate modelling. Corresponding paper describing the package [here in _Methods in Ecology and Evolution_](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13877).

## [microclimc R packaage](https://github.com/ilyamaclean/microclimc)

Most biodiversity lives in microclimates influenced by vegetation, such as forest canopies but also shurblands, meadows, sand savannahs. To help ecologists represent such climate conditions near the earth's surface, _microclimc_ is a mechanistic model, made available through an R package, that leverages first principles physics to predict microclimate above, within, and below the canopy in any terrestrial location on earth. Alongside the microclimate model, several functions are provided to assist data assimilation, as well as different parameterizations to capture a variety of habitats, allowing flexible application even when little is known about the study location. Corresponding paper describing the package [here in _Ecological Modelling_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021001265).

<br>
<br>

Use this web interface to visualize, query, and download data from the Coastal Carbon Clearinghouse. User base is the community of scientists and land managers engaged in understanding and preserving coastal ecosysems. Backend and frontend both written in R with use of R Shiny and Leaflet basemaps, customization with JS and CSS. Displayed data stored in the [CCRCN Data Library](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Data-Library). See our corresponding paper as well ([Holmquist _et al._ 2024 _Global Change Biology_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.17098)).

<br>

{{< image src="/images/data_software/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png" alt="image" width="250">}}
<br>
<br>

An introductory tutorial on how to use R and RStudio to download, re-shape, query, summarize, and plot data (in this case, related to the soil biogeochemistry of coastal wetlands). Tutorial written in R and RMarkdown, customization with CSS and HTML.
