During my tenure with the Smithsonian at the [Conservation Biology Institute](https://nationalzoo.si.edu/conservation) and the [Environmental Research Center](https://serc.si.edu/), I have performed geospatial analyses to determine how landscapes vary in space and time. Using a combination of imagery from satellites and UAVs (drones), we can capture .
