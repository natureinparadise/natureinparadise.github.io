Katie and I had a wonderful 17-day (!!) trip in Patagonia, as a post-PhD defense celebration for her, and a pre-PhD defense celebration for me. I'll spare myself writing too many words here, other than to point to the two videos I put together capturing some of the moments from our two main destinations:

[Torres del Paine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YdQFQhh_lQ)

[El Chalten](lINK)

And, if you want some suggestions on how to take on a trip like this for yourself, here's our [itenerary and travel notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkl3aK42iHjrYrkICOVmxQhfCRS7NErih8ATz_io8uo/edit?usp=sharing) from our trip. Enjoy!
