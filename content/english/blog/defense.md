On 8 May, I had the pleasure of providing a public exit seminar for my PhD at the University of Florida. Truly flattering how many were present either physically or virtually. I've pasted the Acknowledgements from my dissertation at the bottom of this post (just in case you aren't rushing to read the dissertation document itself).

The presentation was followed by a closed-door defense, which was genuinely an enjoyable and educational time, thanks to my committee members Brett, Bette, Miguel, Ethan, and Jonathan.

You can watch the recording of the presentation [here](https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/654d67a68c6f4f57b7d98ddd1d34a8e51d), and the dissertation document is now available on ProQuest [here](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3113362102/abstract/20375C3EB5794E0DPQ/1).</p>
