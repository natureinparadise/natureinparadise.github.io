## Navigation / Important Directories and Files

_Edit the Menu_: config/_default/menus.en.toml  
\_Edit Site Pages_: most pages are stored in content/english  
_Documents_: content/english/docs/ Having a docs/ folder in the root no longer works for hyperlinking
_Images_: assets/images/ (NOT the root images/ dir. That's a derived property)  
_Contact page_: configs/\_default/params.toml
